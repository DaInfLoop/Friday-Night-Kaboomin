# Friday Night Kaboomin'
##### *Getting freaky on a Friday Night yeah-*

Based on the hit game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/FUNKIN), Friday Night Kaboomin' is a port of the game in HTML5! But, doesn't that exist already? Well yes-

This game is made in [Kaboom](https://github.com/replit/kaboom), a JS game engine. It has really good capabilites and I recommend you take a look at it!

It has a HTML5 version (which you can play [here](https://friday-night-kaboomin.dainfloop.repl.co)), and a PC version soon!
